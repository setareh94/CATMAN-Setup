Hello, 

If youre reading this then Doyle probably just told you "hey, you should go work on the GPS"...

Lucky you.

So here's the scoop, basically you have to ensure that the following steps have been completed:

(note that this is for using UART instead of USB)

1. edit the boot file:
	>> sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

then make sure to change:
	dwc_otg.1pm_enable=0 console+ttyAMA0,115200 kgdboc=ttyAMA0,115200 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait

and change it to:
	dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4 elevator=deadline rootwait

Note that this means you just have to remove:
	console=ttyAMA0,115200 and if you see console=serial0,115200 remove that too.

2. now reboot the pi using:
	sudo reboot

3. Now you have to hardwire the gpsd thing with:
	>> sudo killall gpsd
	>> sudo gpsd /dev/ttyAMA0 -F /var/run/gpsd.sock

4. then you should be able to run the GPS with:
	>> cgps -s

note that the gps will blink every second if it's NOT connected, and then blink every 15
seconds if it is connected.


good luck kiddo.
